Suppose that for inputs of size n on a particular computer, insertion sort runs in 8(n^2) steps and merge sort runs in 64n*lgn steps. For which values of n
does insertion sort beat merge sort?

Soln.:
  Insertion sort beats merge sort => Insertion sort faster => Insertion sort takes less time than merge sort

  8(n^2) < 64n*lgn
  8(n^2) - 64n*lgn <0
  8n (n-8lgn)<0
  n-8lgn < 0
  n<8lgn

  [I am not sure if it is log base e or base 10 or base 2]
