requires finding the shortest distance between two points.

  Soln.
  Real world example that requires sorting - dividing students into clasroom based on their grades requires the teacher to sort of the students on the basis
  of their grades. Therefore, grade is sorted in descending order and thus the student with maximum grades is assigned Rank 1 and so on...

  One real world example that required finding shortest distance b/w 2 points:
    Consider you only have fuel to drive for "x" km. Then, we try to find the shortest path distance-wise to sustain the fuel for the journey.
